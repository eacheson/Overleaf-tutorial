# Tutorial 3: Writing publications with Overleaf (Work in progress)

This tutorial in the context of the **Reproducible Research Workshop** provides you with the first steps on how to write publications in Overleaf.

**Objectives of this tutorial:**

* Subscribe to Overleaf
* Create a new Latex project in Overleaf
* Share your project with colleagues
* 

## Motivation
Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor with integrated real-time preview. 
It allows you to collaborate with your co-autors who can review, comment, and edit the document.
Your project is compiled in the background and you can see what it looks like right away.
It offers a rich text mode for those who do not like to work directly in the LaTeX code.

## Part 1: Subscription

**1. Sign up:** To get started you need to sign up for Overleaf on the **[Overleaf webpage](https://www.overleaf.com/)**.

**2. Sign in:** Once you have signed up, you can log into your account. The first time you sign in, you need to verify your e-mail address and to set a password.

**3. Create a new project:** You can now create your first project by pressing on the "create a new project" button. A window will pop up providing you with a choice of possible templates. For now, we choose the blank paper under the heading basics.

A new window opens containing your new project.

The working surface is composed of three areas: 
* The area to the left where you manage the files being part of your document (tex file, bibliography, figures,...) and where you can download your project as a zip-file;
* The part in the middle showing the tex file containing your LaTeX code;
* and the part to the right where your document is displayed as a pdf after compilation (which is done automatically).
