## Motivation
Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor with integrated real-time preview. 
It allows you to collaborate with your co-autors who can review, comment, and edit the document.
Your project is compiled in the background and you can see what it looks like right away.
It offers a rich text mode for those who do not like to work directly in the LaTeX code.
